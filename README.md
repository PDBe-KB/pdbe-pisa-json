## PISA-lite
PISA-lite (Protein Interfaces, surfaces and assemblies) is a softaware developed for the investigation of macromolecular interfaces (such as proteins, DNA/RNA and ligands) and for the identification of probable quaternary structures or assemblies. 

PISA can perfom the following tasks :

1. Explore and identify macromolecular interfaces 
2. Identification of probable assemblies
3. Database searches of structurally similar interfaces and assemblies

The code is the latest version of the PISA code used in CCP4. For more information about PISA software :
